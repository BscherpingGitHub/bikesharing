This give a side by side representation of the graphs 1, 2, 4, 5

## Summary
The results show that this would be a good investment. Des Moines has a great small town presence. This bikes will allow people to make the small trips for in city activites.
Two visualiztions I would suggest are:
1. Look into see what ages were riding the bikes
2. Track what stores or facilites the bikers visited the most.
